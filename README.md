### <span style="color:yellow">To do improvements / think about them:</span>

* ~~Naming of Variables~~
* ~~Passing by reference (actually needed?)~~

* ~~Not relying on compiler for implicit typecast, do explicit.~~

* ~~Instead of dividing anything, take the reciprocal of it and multiply it.~~

* ~~Global definitions/declarations (actually needed?)~~
* Interrupts
* Looking more into calibration function
* Alternative to vTaskDelay() - use State Machine / PWM
* Think upon use of Auto Reload Software Timer?, could have used One Shot Software Timer
* ~~Returning the value from function. (from what point of execution it should be returned)~~
* ~~Using local variables (on which factors to be decided?)~~
