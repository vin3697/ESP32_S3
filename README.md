* ~~Naming of Variables~~

* ~~Passing by reference (actually needed?)~~

* ~~Not relying on compiler for implicit typecast, do explicit.~~

* ~~Instead of dividing anything, take the reciprocal of it and multiply it.~~

* ~~Global definitions/declarations (actually needed?)~~

* ~~Returning the value from function. (from what point of execution it should be returned)~~

* ~~Using local variables (on which factors to be decided?)~~

### Think about below points:
* consideration of Interrupts during execution
* Looking more into ADC calibration function
* Alternative to vTaskDelay() - use of State Machine / PWM
* Think upon use of Auto Reload Software Timer?, could have used One Shot Software Timer?
